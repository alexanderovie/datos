relative keyword popularity rate in a given location
represents location-specific keyword popularity rate over the specified time range;
using this value you can understand how popular a keyword is in one location compared to another location;
calculation: we determine the highest popularity value for the relevant keyword across all locations, and then express all other values as a percentage of that highest value (100);
a value of 100 is the highest popularity for the term
a value of 50 means that the term is half as popular
a value of 0 means there was not enough data for this term
