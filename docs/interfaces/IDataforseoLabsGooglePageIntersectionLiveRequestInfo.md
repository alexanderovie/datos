## Properties

### exclude\_pages?

> **`optional`** **exclude\_pages**: `string`[]

URLs of pages you want to exclude
optional field
you can set up to 10 pages in this array
if you use this array, results will contain the keywords for which URLs from the pages object rank, but URLs from exclude_pages array do not;
note that if you specify this field, the results will be based on the keywords any URL from pages ranks for regardless of intersections between them. However, you can set intersection_mode to intersect and results will contain the keywords all URLs from pages rank for in the same SERP and URLs from exclude_pages do not.
use a wildcard (‘*’) character to specify the search pattern
example:
"exclude_pages": [
"https://www.apple.com/iphone/*",
"https://dataforseo.com/apis/*",
"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/services/"

### filters?

you should set a logical operator and, or between the conditions
the following operators are supported:
regex, <, `<=, >`, >=, =, `<>`, in, not_in, like, not_like
you can use the % operator with like and not_like to match any string of zero or more characters
note that if you want to filter by any field in the intersection_result array you need to specify the number of corresponding page
for instance, if you want to filter results by the ranking of the first specified URL, you should set the following filter:
[intersection_result.1.rank_absolute,"=",1]
if you want to filter results and receive only organic listings for the third specified URL, you should set the following filter:
[intersection_result.3.type,"=","organic"] , etc.example:
["keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume","in",[100,1000]]
[["intersection_result.1.etv",">`",0],"and",["intersection_result.1.description","like","%goat%"]][["keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume",">",100],
"and",
[["intersection_result.2.description","like","%goat%"],
"or",
["intersection_result.2.type","=","organic"]]]
